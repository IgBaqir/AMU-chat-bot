# AMU-chat-bot
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot for our university that provides students, faculty, and visitors with accurate information through natural language queries. By combining document retrieval with an LLM (Large Language Model), it answers questions ranging from FAQs to specific course details and services.
